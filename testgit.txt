this is my first testgit document
we will slowly update all documents of git here .
today i learned installing git and creating git account
creatng local git folder
opening git bash
moving to git folder
 cing list of files in it by ls command
then for configuring github entering user name and email
git configure --global user.name "name"
git configure --global user.email "email"

then cloning git -- copying to local folder
git clone url( url from git hub clone)
readme.md file is created at local folder

create a text file here in this folder and upload to git hub
first create text file and save
then ls to c the file thru cmd prompt 
add it  git add file name
commit it git  commit -m "commit mesg" filename
push it git push -u origin master

once refresh git hub
u can c this file der in github
if we made any changes for text file in local folder
we should save changes

add it
check its status
coomit it
push it
